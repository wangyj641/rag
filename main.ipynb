      "_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving\n",
      "by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies\n",
      "to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very\n",
      "numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it\n",
      "brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as\n",
      "to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by\n",
      "allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and\n",
      "proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet\n",
      "unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be\n",
      "found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the\n",
      "novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger\n",
      "Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted\n",
      "critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that\n",
      "of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with\n",
      "difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling\n",
      "in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite\n",
      "delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly\n",
      "theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost\n",
      "wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that\n",
      "Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might\n",
      "very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;\n",
      "yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and\n",
      "others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and\n",
      "Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does\n",
      "not want them._\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 31:_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes\n",
      "would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present\n",
      "book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss\n",
      "Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge\n",
      "of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the\n",
      "more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather\n",
      "more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most\n",
      "peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the\n",
      "Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,\n",
      "I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It\n",
      "seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most\n",
      "eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention\n",
      "in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show\n",
      "cause._\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 32:_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the\n",
      "reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,\n",
      "when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and\n",
      "finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till\n",
      "1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this\n",
      "combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the\n",
      "critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct\n",
      "superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it\n",
      "possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost\n",
      "regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident\n",
      "could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia\n",
      "and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de\n",
      "théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the\n",
      "story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.\n",
      "All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.\n",
      "Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the\n",
      "same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the\n",
      "hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between\n",
      "Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the\n",
      "intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think\n",
      "the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen\n",
      "always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her\n",
      "opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to\n",
      "be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly\n",
      "natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given\n",
      "by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from\n",
      "the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive\n",
      "aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of\n",
      "the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare\n",
      "say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or\n",
      "garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and\n",
      "delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would\n",
      "certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,\n",
      "which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can\n",
      "avail himself, appear at once on the stage._\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 33:_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to\n",
      "more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest\n",
      "merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts\n",
      "and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it\n",
      "will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite\n",
      "consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built\n",
      "novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which\n",
      "displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all\n",
      "faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot\n",
      "acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the\n",
      "ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one\n",
      "should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what\n",
      "seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her\n",
      "faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John\n",
      "Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,\n",
      "but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still\n",
      "superior to them._\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 34:_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate\n",
      "that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to\n",
      "express, and at any particular time likely to be differently\n",
      "apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a\n",
      "greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of\n",
      "the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of\n",
      "scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,\n",
      "obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,\n",
      "for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in\n",
      "Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was\n",
      "masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of\n",
      "common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,\n",
      "avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a\n",
      "certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those\n",
      "who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the\n",
      "savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness\n",
      "of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that\n",
      "her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much\n",
      "protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a\n",
      "restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in\n",
      "roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,\n",
      "of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early\n",
      "nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,\n",
      "would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate\n",
      "husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the\n",
      "innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play\n",
      "at blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel\n",
      "of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected\n",
      "Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been\n",
      "written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the\n",
      "days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I\n",
      "think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s\n",
      "own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over\n",
      "her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the\n",
      "English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous\n",
      "falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and\n",
      "snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means\n",
      "the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells\n",
      "beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and\n",
      "that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then\n",
      "every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a\n",
      "fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is\n",
      "a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even\n",
      "have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she\n",
      "took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at\n",
      "work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,\n",
      "and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she\n",
      "was immensely the better for it as an artist._\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 35:_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed\n",
      "that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,\n",
      "combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that\n",
      "we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature\n",
      "painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the\n",
      "term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling\n",
      "at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than\n",
      "of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should\n",
      "myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a\n",
      "microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the\n",
      "littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to\n",
      "paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not\n",
      "feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very\n",
      "short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not\n",
      "much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a\n",
      "single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her\n",
      "composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly\n",
      "anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century\n",
      "seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott\n",
      "required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and\n",
      "German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an\n",
      "English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when\n",
      "ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might\n",
      "pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the\n",
      "gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were\n",
      "subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which\n",
      "Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular\n",
      "taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost\n",
      "touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey\n",
      "even in a black one._\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 36:_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which\n",
      "only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the\n",
      "first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are\n",
      "true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she\n",
      "has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes\n",
      "the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any\n",
      "Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously\n",
      "piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get\n",
      "none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can\n",
      "shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the\n",
      "myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.\n",
      "Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book\n",

      "breadth of my nail”--which impressed the half-reluctant Thackeray with\n",
      "just and outspoken admiration. Indeed, fantastic as it may seem, I\n",
      "should put Miss Austen as near to Swift in some ways, as I have put her\n",
      "to Addison in others._\n",

      "nowhere else in the character of the immortal, the ineffable Mr.\n",
      "Collins. Mr. Collins is really_ great; _far greater than anything Addison\n",
      "ever did, almost great enough for Fielding or for Swift himself. It has\n",
      "been said that no one ever was like him. But in the first place,_ he\n",
      "_was like him; he is there--alive, imperishable, more real than hundreds\n",
      "of prime ministers and archbishops, of “metals, semi-metals, and\n",
      "distinguished philosophers.” In the second place, it is rash, I think,\n",
      "to conclude that an actual Mr. Collins was impossible or non-existent at\n",
      "the end of the eighteenth century. It is very interesting that we\n",
      "possess, in this same gallery, what may be called a spoiled first\n",
      "draught, or an unsuccessful study of him, in John Dashwood. The\n",
      "formality, the under-breeding, the meanness, are there; but the portrait\n",
      "is only half alive, and is felt to be even a little unnatural. Mr.\n",
      "Collins is perfectly natural, and perfectly alive. In fact, for all the\n",
      "“miniature,” there is something gigantic in the way in which a certain\n",

      "humanity, its Philistinism, its well-meaning but hide-bound morality,\n",
      "its formal pettiness, its grovelling respect for rank, its materialism,\n",
      "its selfishness, receives exhibition. I will not admit that one speech\n",

      "replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not\n",
      "discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed\n",

      "me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,\n",
      "that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be\n",

      "her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the\n",
      "train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made\n",
      "her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that\n",

      "of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such\n",
      "a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,\n",
      "were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a\n",
      "comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be\n",
      "certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It\n",
      "was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as\n",
      "Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;\n",
      "and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to\n",
      "consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might\n",
      "not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary\n",
      "to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such\n",

      "whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the\n",
      "chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her\n",

      "\n",
      "Chunk 911:Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would\n",

      "blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently\n",

      "tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she\n",
      "had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,\n",
      "preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent\n",
      "entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of\n",
      "complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an\n",
      "opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.\n",
      "Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and\n",
      "she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience\n",
      "which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving\n",
      "amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be\n",
      "prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute\n",
      "began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;\n",
      "her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.\n",
      "She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly\n",
      "talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making\n",
      "signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,\n",
      "impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his\n",
      "interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,\n",
      "and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--\n",
      "\n",

      "Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 914:Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and\n",
      "Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid\n",
      "her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 915:“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I\n",
      "should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an\n",
      "air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly\n",
      "compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,\n",
      "to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to\n",
      "music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The\n",
      "rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such\n",
      "an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not\n",
      "offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time\n",
      "that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care\n",
      "and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making\n",
      "as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance\n",
      "that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards\n",

      "his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the\n",
      "room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.\n",
      "Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for\n",
      "having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady\n",
      "Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.\n",

      "Chunk 916:To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to\n",
      "expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would\n",
      "have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or\n",
      "finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister\n",
      "that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his\n",
      "feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he\n",
      "must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should\n",
      "have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and\n",
      "she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or\n",
      "the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 917:The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by\n",

      "power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with\n",
      "somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the\n",
      "room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent\n",
      "to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend\n",
      "himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining\n",
      "close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a\n",
      "project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who\n",
      "often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation\n",
      "to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 918:She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:\n",
      "though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite\n",
      "disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the\n",
      "probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in\n",
      "it.\n",

      "manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an\n",
      "hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how\n",
      "heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her\n",
      "sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\n",
      "were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\n",
      "every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\n",

      "his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some\n",

      "neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were\n",
      "in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious\n",

      "happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the\n",

      "respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance\n",
      "with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and\n",
      "owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way\n",
      "through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an\n",
      "interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out\n",
      "with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the\n",
      "fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in\n",
      "the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which\n",
      "the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with\n",

      "help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything\n",
      "was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which\n",

      "\n",
      "Chunk 1485:“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n",
      "magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\n",
      "that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\n",
      "from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\n",
      "claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\n",
      "prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\n",
      "wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\n",
      "favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\n",
      "dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\n",
      "its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\n",
      "persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\n",
      "bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\n",
      "night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\n",
      "to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\n",
      "their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\n",
      "to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\n",
      "offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\n",
      "be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\n",
      "Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\n",
      "preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\n",
      "it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\n",
      "apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\n",
      "in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\n",
      "you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\n",
      "information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\n",
      "a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\n",
      "event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n",
      "observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\n",
      "that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\n",
      "in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\n",
      "cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\n",
      "regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\n",
      "though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\n",
      "them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\n",
      "here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\n",
      "sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\n",
      "by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n",
      "unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\n",
      "your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\n",
      "acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\n",
      "was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\n",
      "her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\n",
      "investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\n",
      "fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\n",
      "believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\n",
      "My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\n",
      "acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\n",
      "in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n",
      "my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\n",
      "which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\n",
      "instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\n",
      "immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\n",
      "situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\n",
      "comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\n",
      "uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\n",
      "occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\n",
      "you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\n",
      "and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n",
      "consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\n",
      "any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\n",
      "you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\n",
      "disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\n",
      "that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\n",
      "inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\n",
      "friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\n",
      "Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\n",
      "remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\n",
      "now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\n",
      "with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\n",
      "sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\n",
      "shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\n",
      "went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\n",
      "friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\n",
      "earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\n",
      "his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\n",
      "prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\n",
      "I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\n",
      "believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\n",
      "regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\n",
      "dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\n",
      "that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\n",
      "him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\n",
      "given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\n",
      "having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\n",
      "affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\n",
      "condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\n",
      "your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\n",
      "Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\n",
      "have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\n",
      "did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\n",
      "danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\n",
      "done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\n",
      "nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\n",
      "sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n",
      "governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\n",
      "yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\n",
      "accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\n",
      "laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\n",
      "has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\n",
      "shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\n",
      "Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\n",
      "the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\n",
      "the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\n",
      "to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\n",
      "therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n",
      "afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\n",
      "always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\n",
      "give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\n",
      "young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\n",
      "highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\n",
      "intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\n",
      "since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\n",
      "vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\n",
      "guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\n",
      "observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\n",
      "had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\n",
      "could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\n",
      "only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\n",
      "created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\n",
      "his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n",
      "died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\n",
      "last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\n",
      "promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\n",
      "allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\n",
      "might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\n",
      "one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\n",
      "within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\n",
      "that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\n",
      "not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n",
      "pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n",
      "benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\n",
      "must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\n",
      "insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\n",
      "sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\n",
      "proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\n",
      "business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\n",
      "in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\n",
      "receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\n",
      "between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\n",
      "to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\n",
      "chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\n",
      "now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\n",
      "dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\n",
      "decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\n",
      "he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\n",
      "circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\n",
      "were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n",
      "and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\n",
      "him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\n",
      "doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\n",
      "and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\n",
      "hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\n",
      "resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\n",
      "the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\n",
      "his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\n",
      "period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\n",
      "know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\n",
      "notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n",
      "myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\n",
      "to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\n",
      "your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\n",
      "to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\n",
      "myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\n",
      "establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\n",
      "the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\n",
      "Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\n",
      "acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\n",
      "most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\n",
      "recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\n",
      "strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\n",
      "persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\n",
      "was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n",
      "imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n",
      "herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\n",
      "elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\n",
      "and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\n",
      "acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\n",
      "acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\n",
      "exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\n",
      "and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\n",
      "chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\n",
      "thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\n",
      "himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\n",
      "complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\n",
      "which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\n",
      "reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n",
      "towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n",
      "falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\n",
      "wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\n",
      "either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\n",

      "Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\n",
      "still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\n",
      "unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\n",

      "\n",
      "Chunk 1719:Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired\n",
      "every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for\n",
      "half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable\n",
      "eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by\n",
      "Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which\n",
      "the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone\n",
      "building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high\n",
      "woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was\n",
      "swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks\n",
      "were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She\n",
      "had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural\n",
      "beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were\n",
      "all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that\n",
      "to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1720:They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,\n",
      "while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of\n",
      "meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\n",
      "mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\n",

      "\n",
      "Chunk 1721:The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\n",
      "fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\n",
      "followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\n",
      "room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\n",
      "to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\n",
      "which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\n",
      "distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\n",
      "good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\n",
      "on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\n",
      "it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\n",
      "taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\n",
      "to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\n",
      "suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\n",
      "admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\n",

      "furniture of Rosings.\n",

      "or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\n",

      "discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\n",
      "moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\n",
      "again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\n",
      "strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\n",
      "her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\n",
      "family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\n",
      "never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\n",
      "What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\n",

      "to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\n",
      "distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\n",
      "one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\n",
      "was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\n",
      "what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\n",
      "she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\n",
      "felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\n",
      "not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\n",

      "\n",
      "Chunk 1773:They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\n",
      "ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\n",
      "of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\n",
      "the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\n",
      "overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\n",
      "expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\n",
      "beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\n",
      "miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\n",
      "circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\n",
      "hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\n",
      "They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\n",
      "the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\n",
      "the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\n",
      "stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\n",
      "it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\n",
      "the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\n",
      "who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\n",
      "returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\n",
      "therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\n",
      "on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\n",
      "progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\n",
      "taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\n",
      "occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\n",
      "about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\n",
      "slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was\n",
      "quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\n",
      "approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\n",
      "sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\n",
      "met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\n",
      "interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\n",
      "calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\n",
      "she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\n",
      "lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\n",
      "turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\n",
      "he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\n",
      "she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\n",
      "got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky\n",
      "recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\n",
      "her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\n",
      "no more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1774:Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\n",
      "her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\n",
      "This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\n",
      "she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\n",
      "acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\n",
      "revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought\n",
      "she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\n",
      "fashion.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1775:The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\n",
      "relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\n",
      "it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\n",
      "could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\n",
      "connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\n",
      "so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\n",
      "conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\n",
      "could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\n",
      "relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\n",
      "attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\n",
      "expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\n",
      "his taste, or his good manners.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1776:The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\n",
      "invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\n",
      "chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\n",
      "time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\n",
      "the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\n",
      "walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\n",
      "wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\n",
      "compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\n",
      "extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From\n",
      "what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\n",
      "that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\n",
      "work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\n",
      "me.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1777:After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\n",
      "gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\n",
      "brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\n",
      "water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\n",
      "Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\n",
      "Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\n",
      "her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\n",
      "together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\n",
      "know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\n",
      "place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\n",
      "very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that\n",
      "you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\n",
      "left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\n",
      "the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\n",
      "business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\n",
      "before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They\n",
      "will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some\n",
      "who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1778:Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\n",
      "driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned\n",
      "between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\n",
      "not very differently engaged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1779:“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a\n",
      "pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\n",
      "me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\n",
      "during your stay at Lambton?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1780:The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\n",
      "for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\n",
      "that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\n",
      "must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\n",
      "satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\n",
      "him think really ill of her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1781:They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\n",
      "was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\n",
      "pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\n",
      "the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\n",
      "reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\n",
      "mile behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1782:He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\n",
      "tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\n",
      "have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\n",
      "there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\n",
      "she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\n",
      "great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\n",
      "and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1783:On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into\n",
      "the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\n",
      "parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\n",
      "ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\n",
      "walking slowly towards the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1784:The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them\n",
      "pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.\n",

      "aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now\n",
      "say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n",
      "_I_ have seen nothing of it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1787:“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\n",
      "than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\n",
      "attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1788:“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;\n",
      "or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are\n",
      "perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\n",
      "disagreeable?”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1789:Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\n",
      "him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\n",
      "seen him so pleasant as this morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1790:“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied\n",
      "her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\n",
      "at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\n",
      "warn me off his grounds.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1791:Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1792:“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really\n",
      "should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\n",
      "anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\n",
      "On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\n",
      "speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\n",
      "not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\n",
      "good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\n",
      "I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\n",
      "master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\n",
      "every virtue.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chunk 1793:Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\n",
      "his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\n",
      "guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\n",
      "relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\n",
      "construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\n",
      "Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\n",
      "confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\n",

      "approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\n",
      "the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\n",
      "to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\n",
      "anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had\n",
      "no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\n",

      "     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\n",

      "     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\n",
      "     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\n",
      "     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as\n",
      "     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\n",
      "     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\n",
      "     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\n",
      "     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\n",
      "     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\n",
      "     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\n",
      "     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\n",
      "     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\n",
      "     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\n",
      "     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\n",
      "     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\n",
      "     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\n",
      "     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\n",
      "     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\n",
      "     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\n",
      "     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\n",
      "     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\n",
      "     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he\n",
      "     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\n",
      "     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\n",
      "     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\n",
      "     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\n",
      "     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\n",
      "     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\n",
      "     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\n",
      "     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\n",
      "     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\n",
      "     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\n",
      "     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\n",
      "     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\n",
      "     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\n",
      "     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\n",
      "     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\n",
      "     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\n",
      "     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\n",
      "     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\n",
      "     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\n",
      "     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\n",
      "     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\n",
      "     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\n",
      "     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\n",
      "     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\n",
      "     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\n",
      "     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\n",
      "     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\n",
      "     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\n",
      "     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\n",
      "     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\n",
      "     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\n",
      "     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\n",
      "     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\n",
      "     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\n",
      "     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make\n",
      "     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\n",
      "     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\n",
      "     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\n",
      "     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\n",
      "     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\n",
      "     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\n",
      "     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\n",
      "     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\n",
      "     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\n",
      "     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\n",
      "     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\n",
      "     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\n",
      "     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\n",
      "     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\n",
      "     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\n",
      "     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\n",
      "     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\n",
      "     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\n",
      "     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\n",
      "     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\n",
      "     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\n",
      "     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\n",
      "     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\n",
      "     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\n",
      "     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\n",
      "     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\n",
      "     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\n",
      "     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\n",
      "     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\n",
      "     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\n",
      "     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\n",
      "     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\n",
      "     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\n",
      "     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character\n",
      "     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\n",
      "     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n",
      "     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_\n",
      "     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\n",
      "     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\n",
      "     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\n",
      "     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\n",
      "     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\n",
      "     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\n",
      "     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\n",
      "     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\n",
      "     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\n",
      "     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\n",
      "     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\n",
      "     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\n",
      "     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\n",
      "     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter\n",
      "     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\n",
      "     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\n",
      "     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\n",
      "     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\n",
      "     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\n",
      "     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\n",
      "     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\n",
      "     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\n",
      "     in his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He\n",

      "the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often\n",
      "found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but\n",
      "the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when\n",
